= Windows Event Forwarding / Collection
:toc:
:toc-title:

== Introduction
Several techniques exist to centralize the collection of Windows events. One of
these techniques is native to the Windows Operating System (OS) and exist of the
following two main components:

* Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)
* Windows Event Collector (WEC)

An advantage of this technique over other techniques is that WEF/WEC allows one
to retain the Windows XML Eventlog (EVTX) format of events. This allows for greater
flexibility when processing these events from a centralized point in your 
infrastructure. The visualization below shows the several components which make
up the WEF/WEC architecture.

The Event Collector is a Windows Service which can be run on any Windows OS such as
Windows 10 and Windows server 2019. The main functionality of this service is to accept forwarded
events and manage subscriptions. In a nutshell Subscriptions are used by the 
Event Collector to define the events that it would like to receive, how these 
events should be forwarded and which clients should forward the events described 
in the subscription. 

Subscriptions can be configured in one of the following two modes:

* **Pull** - Collector initiated
* **Push** - Source computer initiated

Although WEF/WEC is usually deployed inside a Windows Active Directory domain
one can also deploy WEF/WEC without an Active Directory domain. A mixed deployment
of domain and non-domain joined computers is also possible. On this page we
only focus on a deployment of WEF/WEC inside a Windows Active Directory domain
using source computer initiated subscriptions.

The Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin's responsibility is to forward events to the Event Collector.
Please note that it's also possible to configure the aforementioned component on the Event
Collector itself to forward different events to a specific (single) event log.
In regards to the network communication, the Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin uses TCP port 5985
to contact the Event Collector. WinRM is used as communication mechanism between the 
Event Collector and Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin. Communication is authenticated and encrypted
using Kerberos. This applies specifically to WEF/WEC deployments inside a Windows Active Directory
domain. In absence of an Active Directory domain, TCP port 5986 is used. Such an environment
also requires the setup and configuration of a TLS-certificate.

[IMPORTANT]
Additional security hardening of systems hosting the WEC-functionality is recommended as these systems
contain forwarded event logging from multiple (if not all) Windows systems in your environment.
These events could for example, be of interest during attacker's reconnaissance of the environment.

== Scaling WEC/WEF

=== Hardware Configuration
Microsoft recommends to deploy one Event Collector for every 2000 to 4000 Windows systems
from which you want to collect event logging. Each Event Collector needs to be configured
with at least 16 GB of RAM and 4 processor cores. This recommendation applies to a
deployment with at most two subscriptions configured.


.Windows Server Updates
[NOTE]
====
Specifically for Event Collectors running Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 the
following update needs to be installed with respect to the install Windows Server edition
footnoteref:[wec-performance,pass:[<a class="bare" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/admin-development/configure-eventlog-forwarding-performance">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/admin-development/configure-eventlog-forwarding-performance</a>]].

* KB4537806 (Windows Server 2016)
* KB4537818 (Windows Server 2019)

Both updates are described as updates which improve the scalability of the Event Collector
functionality.
====

=== Timers
Subscriptions can be configured with several timers. The list of timers and timer-related
parameters can be found in the list below.

* Refresh
* DeliveryMaxLatency
* HeartbeatInterval
* Event batch size

In the remainder of this section we discuss the parameters listed above. Furthermore, we
also discuss several trade-offs related to configuring these timers as well as predefined
profiles which can be used. 

==== Refresh
Compared to the other parameters the Refresh parameter is the
only parameter which isn't defined within the subscription. Instead this parameter is defined
in the `Configure target Subscription Manager` GPO-setting. This value is appended to
the same string which defines the Event Collector URL. As separation character a `,`
comma is being used. For example if we want to configure the Refresh parameter on 60
seconds, `Server=http://collector.example.com:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC`
becomes the following.
```
Server=http://collector.example.com:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
```
This parameter defines how often a client needs to contact the Event Collector for updates
to the subscription. The Event Collector responds with a list of subscriptions applicable
to the client. By default the Refresh parameter is configured to `900 seconds` which
is the same as 15 minutes. Microsoft recommends to adjust this parameter based on the
frequency in which you apply changes to subscriptions. If subscriptions don't change
frequently this parameter should be configured in the range of hours
footnoteref:[wec-performance].

==== DeliveryMaxLatency
The DeliveryMaxLatency parameter is used to control the frequency of connections made
from a forwarding system to the Event Collector. This parameter is configured in milliseconds.
Attention should be payed to this parameter when interested in modifying the time between
an event being generated and that same event being forwarded to the Event Collector.

==== HeartbeatInterval
The HeartbeatInterval is used to determine after which time a forwarding system should be
marked as inactive on the Event Collector. As with the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter, this 
parameter is also configured in milliseconds. The HeartbeatInterval parameter should be 
configured equal to or larger than the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter
footnoteref:[wec-performance].

==== Event batch size
The fourth parameter called event batch size determines how many events should be generated
before events are forwarded to the Event Collector. If the configured amount of subscriptions
is reached before the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter is reached, the batched events are 
forwarded to the Event Collector anyway. 


==== Event Delivery Optimizations
Subscriptions can be configured with so-called Event Delivery Optimizations. These 
optimizations can be thought of as profiles
with pre-configured values for the DeliveryMaxLatency and HeartbeatInterval parameters. 
Four different optimizations can be selected:

* Normal
* Minimize Bandwidth
* Minimize Latency
* Custom

Normal Event Delivery Optimization pre-configures both the DeliveryMaxLatency and
HeartbeatInterval parameters to 15 minutes. This profile is selected by default. With the 
Minimize Bandwidth profile both the DeliveryMaxLatency and HeartbeatInterval parameters are configured 
to 6 hours. The goal of this profile is to reduce the amount of connections that have to be 
made between the Event Collector and Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin. The Minimize Latency profile configures
the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter to 30 seconds. The HeartbeatInterval parameter is configured on 1 hour. 
The final optimization profile is Custom and can not be configured through Event Viewer. Instead `wecutil`
should be used to configure the DeliveryMaxLatency and HeartbeatInterval parameters to a value
to one's choosing. Optionally one can configure an Event batch size value.

To change the Event Delivery Optimization profile to Custom execute the following command.
```
wecutil ss <subscription_name> /cm:custom
```

The `ss` (set-subscription) is used to edit a specific subscription. Parameter `cm` (Config mode)
is then used to specify the Event Delivery Optimization profile. Other valid values are: `Normal`,
`MinLatency` or `MinBandwidth`. This modification initializes the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter in
the subscription to 15 minutes and the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter to 1 hour. In order to then
configure the DeliveryMaxLatency parameter execute the command below.
```
wecutil ss <subscription_name> /dmlt:<milliseconds>
```   

One can alter the value specified to the HeartbeatInterval parameter using the command below.
```
wecutil ss <subscription_name> /hi:<milliseconds>
```

Using the `/dmi` parameter the Event batch size can optionally be configured.
```
wecutil ss <subscription_name> /dmi:<integer>
```

When for example the network experiences negative impact when choosing one of the three pre-configured
Event Delivery Optimizations or the amount of connections degrades the performance of the Event Collector
altering the previously mentioned parameters could alleviate these issues. When altering these parameters
take the current load of the network en compute infrastructure into account. 

[IMPORTANT]
Each time a client contacts the Event Collector a connection over WinRM between the Event Collector and 
Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin is created. As the amount of systems that forward their events to the Event 
Collector grows this could have a negative performance impact on the Event Collector. Increasing the 
DeliveryMaxLatency parameter may help
footnoteref:[wec-performance].

Furthermore, be aware that
the "Normal" Event Delivery Optimization may cause high memory usage when the collector accepts events
of 2000 to 4000 clients.

=== Event Format
By default a subscription will instruct the forwarding systems to include the rendered text of an event
in the forwarded event. The rendered text is the text you see when viewing an event through Event
Viewer. A forwarded event's XML will look as follows when configured with the so-called RenderedText
option.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::content_format_renderedtext.png[align="center"]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img src="images/content_format_renderedtext.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

Specifically the RenderedText option will include the `<RenderingInfo>` element and sub elements in the
forwarded event. Based on the amount of text inside the RenderingInfo element this can double or triple
the size of the forwarded event. This in turn has a negative impact of the storage of events on the Event
Collector. If you don't require the data contained within the RenderingInfo element for processing you can
configure the subscription to instruct the forwarding systems not include rendered text. This is done through
the following command.
```
wecutil ss <subscription_name> /cf:Events
```

The same event ID's binary Event XML will now look as follows.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::content_format_events.png[align="center"]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img src="images/content_format_events.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

Please note that Event Viewer will still render the event's text when viewing the forwarded event through
Event Viewer on the Event Collector. Therefore, this change doesn't impact the viewing of events through
Event Viewer.



== Configuration Steps
In this section we show how to configure WEF/WEC inside a Windows Active Directory environment
consisting of the following systems and roles:

* **DC01.example.com** - Domain Controller of the example.com domain. This system runs Windows Server
2019 Standard edition version 1809.
* **EC01.example.com** - The Event Collector of the example.com domain which runs Windows Server
2019 Standard edition version 1809.
* **WS01.example.com** - WS01 is the workstation of our example.com domain which runs
the Professional edition of Windows 10 version 20H2.

The steps below imply that the systems mentioned above are running in a clean Active Directory
domain in which they just joined.

=== Step 1: Enable PowerShell Remoting
In order to enable PowerShell Remoting on the Event Collector (`EC01`), execute the PowerShell 
command below from inside a PowerShell window.
```
Enable-PSRemoting
```

[WARNING]
.Security considerations
When configuring PowerShell Remoting you're essentially increasing the potential
attack surface of a system. Please see Microsoft's webpage on security considerations on
PowerShell Remoting in order to gain an understanding of the security impact
footnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/winrmsecurity].

In order to verify that PowerShell remoting is enabled we execute the command below on
a workstation (`WS01`). Invoke-Command executes the `hostname` command on our Event Collector
(`EC01`). 
```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName EC01.EXAMPLE.COM -ScriptBlock {hostname}
```
In our case `EC01` (the hostname of the Event Collector) should be returned. Please note that the
user which you use to log in on the workstation for this test needs to be a member of one of
the following two local groups on the Event Collector (`EC01`):

* Administrators
* Remote Management Users 

=== Step 2: Enable the Event Collector Service
On the Event Collector (`EC01`) log in and open a command prompt with elevated permissions. 
Inside the command prompt run the command below in order to automatically start the Windows
Event Collector service (wecsvc) at boot.
```
sc config wecsvc start=auto
```

=== Step 3: Add NETWORK SERVICE to Event Log Readers
In order to access the event log on the Event Collector (`EC01`), the `NETWORK SERVICE` 
account which is used by WinRM needs to be a member of the local `Event Log Readers` group. 
This is accomplished by configuring the GPO below and applying it to the computer account
of the Event Collector (`EC01`).

ifndef::env-github[]
image::collector_gpo.png[align="center"]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img src="images/collector_gpo.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

Please note that when adding the `NETWORK SERVICE` account to the `Event Log Readers` group
an error is generated. However, this error can be ignored. Just click `close` and click
`ok` again. The aforementioned error message is shown in the image below.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::NETWORK_SERVICE_error.png[align="center",500,500]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="20%" src="images/NETWORK_SERVICE_error.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

In step 1 we already warned about the impact of enabling PowerShell Remoting. To reduce the
attack surface we configure the `Allow remote server management through WinRM` option. This
option allows one to specify from which IP-addresses to accept WS-Management traffic. In our
environment we only want to accept traffic from the local network which has the `10.0.10.0/24`
subnet configured. Inside the `IPv4 filter` option we specify `10.0.10.1-10.0.10.254` as value.
It's not possible to specify networks in CDIR-format. Multiple IP-ranges can be specified 
by separating each range by a comma (`,`). Using the `IPv6 filter` option allowed ranges can
be specified for WS-Management traffic using IPv6. In our case we don't use IPv6 so we leave
this option empty. This results in denying any WS-Management traffic over IPv6.

=== Step 4: Configure Forwarded Events Log
Eventually we configure the Event Collector to store the forwarded events into the `Forwarded
Events` log. The default behavior of Windows logs is to store events up to a maximum size of
20480 KB (20.48 MB). When this size is reached the oldest events will be overwritten by new
events. These default settings may pose a problem when an incident is detected that happened
in the past and events generated around the time of the incident are required. In this step we
modify these default values in order to use the Forwarded Events log on the Event Collector as
an archiving solution. First open Event Viewer on the Event Collector and right click on
`Forwarded Events` in the list on the left. Inside the context menu click on `Properties`.
This action will pop up the window below.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::forwarded_events_properties.png[align="center",600,600]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="20%" src="images/forwarded_events_properties.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

As value for `Maximum log size` we specify `4194304` (4 GB). Furthermore we select the 
`Archive the log when full, do not overwrite events` option under `When maximum event log size
is reached`. By selecting the archiving option the current event log's `.evtx` file will be 
renamed to the following format. 
```
Archive-<logname>-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<HH>-<MM>-<SS>-<MS>.evtx
```
An example of an archived event log is shown below.
```
Archive-Security-2020-10-23-08-22-01-134.evtx
```
After renaming the current event log's `.evtx`, a new event log file will be created in the same
directory for handling new events. Be aware that selecting this option requires additional 
hard disk capacity footnoteref:[wec-performance].

[WARNING]
.No space left on volume
When there's no space left on the volume on which the event log is stored, the writing of forwarded
events will come to a halt. Increasing the size of the volume alleviates this issue. However,
this can result in loss of data when events are forwarded while the volume is full.
To prevent a volume with no storage space left, make sure to monitor the volume's storage usage.

Microsoft recommends to plan each Event Collector to be able to handle at least 3000 events per
second (EPS). If it's suspected that the hard disk(s) for volume C cannot handle this number of
EPS, move the log file's location to a hard disk which can handle the write speed equal to 3000
EPS. The `Log Path` option can be used to specify an alternative location for the Forwarded Events
log.

[NOTE]
.Moving log location
When moving the log location, the events inside the previous log file location aren't moved to
the log file in the new location. Preferably one should first copy the log file in
the current location to the new location before changing the Log Path value in the properties
window of the Event log.


=== Step 5: Modify the WS-Management URL-ACL
This step is applicable for Windows Server 2019 Event Collectors with more than
3.5 GB of memory. If the Event Collector is running Windows Server 2016 with a
modified service host grouping configuration which splits the grouping of the
WinRM and Event Collector service into two separate processes, this step also
applies. Note that by default this isn't the case with Windows Server 2016.
A more thorough explanation of this issue can be found on Microsoft's website
footnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/admin-development/events-not-forwarded-by-windows-server-collector].


Execute the commands below inside a command prompt run with elevated
privileges in order to add the service SID of the Windows Event Collector (wecsvc) 
service to the `http://+:5985/wsman/` URL-ACL. This URL is used by the Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin 
to forward Event logging. 

```
netsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:5985/wsman/
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:5985/wsman/ sddl=D:(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-569256582-2953403351-2909559716-1301513147-412116970)(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-4059739203-877974739-1245631912-527174227-2996563517)
netsh http delete urlacl url=https://+:5986/wsman/
netsh http add urlacl url=https://+:5986/wsman/ sddl=D:(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-569256582-2953403351-2909559716-1301513147-412116970)(A;;GX;;;S-1-5-80-4059739203-877974739-1245631912-527174227-2996563517)
```
The Event Collector (`EC01`) must be restarted afterwards.

=== Step 6: Configure the Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin
In order to enable the Windows systems to forward events we configure a GPO which contains the 
following settings:

* Add the `NETWORK SERVICE` to the `Event Log Readers` group. The same error from step
3 can be ignored when configuring this setting.
* Enable the `Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)` service to start automatically.
For Windows server editions this is already the case.
* Configure the Event Collector's URL: `Server=http://<collector-FQDN>:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC`

On each client we recommend the following maximum log sizes for specific Windows logs:

* **Application** - 1048576 KB (1 GB)
* **Security** - 4194304 KB (4 GB)
* **System** - 1048576 KB (1 GB)

Compared to the default maximum log sizes this allows for extended log retention on the
client systems. The image below shows the GPO-settings which should be configured. 
Furthermore, this GPO should be scoped on the computer accounts from which you want
to receive events.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/forwarder_gpo.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

=== Step 7: Creating Subscriptions
For completeness we finally show you how to create subscriptions yourself. If you're
only interested in importing the subscription contained within this repository you
can move on to the next step.

This step configures the subscriptions which will tell the Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin which event logs should be forwarded and configures the communication with the Event Collector.
On the Event Collector (`EC01`) open Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`) and navigate in the left list
to `Subscriptions`. Opening the subscriptions overview for the first time shows the infobox 
message below.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::subscriptions_first_time.png[align="center",500,500]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="20%" src="images/subscriptions_first_time.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

If the window above pops up, click "Yes". Afterwards right click on `Subscriptions` and click
inside the context menu on `Create Subscription...`.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::01_create_subscription.png[align="center",200,200]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="20%" height="20%" src="images/01_create_subscription.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::02_configure_subscription.png[align="center",500,500]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="20%" src="images/02_configure_subscription.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

Inside the window that just opened we can create a subscription. First apply a name to the 
subscription and optionally a description. Under `Subscription type and source computers`
select `Source computer initiated` and select the computers from which you want to
receive forwarded Event logging. These computers can be selected by clicking on the
`Select Computer Groups...` button. By clicking on `Select Events...` we can configure
which events we want to collect. This is done the same way as one would filter a local
log. The image below shows an example filter which dictates that we want to receive the
full `Security` log. 

ifndef::env-github[]
image::03_configure_filter.png[align="center",500,500]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="20%" src="images/03_configure_filter.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

After applying the filter one can click `OK` in order to create the subscription.

[NOTE]
.Advanced filtering
In the image above there also exists an XML-tab. This tab can be used to develop an event filter 
in XML-format using XPath 1.0 statements. This allows one to develop advanced event filters which
can be copied between subscription configurations. Microsoft published a blog posting on this subject
which describes the usage and limitations of XML-based Event filtering
footnote:[https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/advanced-xml-filtering-in-the-windows-event-viewer/ba-p/399761].

=== Step 8: Importing Subscriptions
Before executing this step, make sure to first follow the configuration steps described
on the {uri-logging}[Windows Event Logging] page. Next we import the subscription file
contained within this repository into the Event Collector (`EC01`). First make sure the
`subscription.xml` contained within the `subscriptions` directory is available on 
the Event Collector (`EC01`). Open a command prompt with elevated privileges, navigate 
to the directory containing the XML-subscription and execute the command below.
```
wecutil cs subscription.xml
```

The command above uses the `cs` (create subscription) parameter to create
a new subscription with the provided XML-file as input. By default the imported subscription
instruct computers that are member of the following groups to forward event logs:

* Domain Computers
* Domain Controllers

Apart from the groups above, the `NETWORK SERVICE` account is also included in the scope.
This account is included for forwarding the event log of the Event Collector itself
systemfootnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wec/setting-up-a-source-initiated-subscription].

== Debugging WEC/WEF
This section describes common configuration issues including the way to resolve each issue.
Before diving into the specifics we want to share common actions and sources which can be
executed and used when troubleshooting WEC/WEF configurations.

On the Event Collector an event channel `EventCollector/Operational` exist. This event channel
can be viewed from e.g. Event Viewer by navigating to `Applications and Services Logs >
Microsoft > Windows > Event Collector > Operational` using the list on the left side.
Besides events related to the Event Collector service this event channel also contains events
generated when configuring subscriptions.

When trying to figure out why events aren't being forwarded even though the subscription
was successfully activated, one can look at the events generated in the `Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin/Operational`
channel on the forwarding systems. As with the earlier mentioned event channel on the event
collector this event channel can be inspected using Event Viewer on the forwarding system
by navigating to `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin >
Operational` using the list on the left. This event channel primarily contains events
generated when connecting to an Event Collector based on a received subscription. 

In the Timers section we explain the specific timers that are related to subscriptions and
communication between the Event Collector and Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin. However, if one
wants to force a connection to the Event Collector based on a subscription the command
below can be executed on the forwarding systems. Apart from forcing a connection to the
Event Collector this also updates the Group Policy settings. This command is usually used
for accomplishing the latter.
```
gpupdate /force
```

The remainder of this section focusses on specific issues one can encounter when configuring
WEF/WEC using the steps we laid out at the start of this page. If after following the steps
to configure WEF/WEC no events are being forwarded to the Event Collector execute the
`gpupdate /force` command on the forwarding system. Afterwards inspect the events 
generated inside the `Eventlog-ForwardingPlugin/Operational` channel. When the event in the
image below is generated make sure step 4 is executed successfully on the Event Collector.
Don't forget to reboot the Event Collector afterwards. Otherwise the changes aren't
effective.

ifndef::env-github[] 
image::event_105.png[align="center"]
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
++++
<p align="center">
<img src="images/event_105.png"/>
</p>
++++
endif::[]

When importing the subscription in step 8 the error below is generated.
```
Failed to open subscription. Error = 0x6ba.
The RPC server is unavailable.
```
This error is caused due to the fact that the Event Collector service isn't active on the
Event Collector. Make sure the Event Collector service is started and execute step 8 again.
